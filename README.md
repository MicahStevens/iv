iv -- Image Viewer
=========================

A simple image viewer that can recursively display images from directories in a
grid. Click on any image to display it full size.

Supports all image formats used on the web including animated GIFs and SVG.

Uses a browser engine (chromium) to do the rendering, so its format support
will always be current.
